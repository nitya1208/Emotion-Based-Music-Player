# Emotion-Based-Music-Player
This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face and plays relavant music
# Abstract
Human expression plays a vital role in determining the current state and mood of an individual,
it helps in extracting and understanding the emotion that an Individual has based on various
features of the face such as eyes, cheeks, forehead or even through the curve of the smile. Music
is basically an art form that soothes and calms human brain and body. Taking these two aspects
and blending them together our project deals with detecting emotion of an individual through
facial expression and playing music according to the mood detected that will alleviate the
mood or simply calm the individual and can also get quicker song according to the mood,
saving time from looking up different songs and parallel developing a software that can be
used anywhere with the help of providing the functionality of playing music according to the
emotion detected. By developing a recommendation system, it could assist a user to make
a decision regarding which music one should listen to helping the user to reduce his/her stress
levels. The image of the user is captured with the help of a webcam. The user’s picture is
taken and then as per the mood/ emotion of the user an appropriate song from the playlist of
the user is shown matching the user’s requirement.

# Proposed System
The proposed system can detect the facial expressions of the user and based on his/her facial
expressions extract the facial landmarks, which would then be classified to get a particular
emotion of the user. Once the emotion has been classified the songs matching the user's
emotions would be shown to the user.
Thus, our proposed system focuses on detecting human emotions for developing
emotion-based music player. A brief idea about our systems working, playlist generation and
classification.

In this system live face emotion is detected using webcam where in the facial
expressions are detected, captured and classified into their respective type accordingly the
system plays music from the collected facial expressions. This system makes use of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The model trains itself
according to the results thus improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.
Emotion base Music Player is a useful application for music listeners with a smart phone and
an internet connection. The Application is accessible by anyone who creates a Profile on the
system. The Application is designed to meet the following needs of the users as described
below;

# Conclusion
Experimental results have shown that the time required for audio feature extraction is negligibie and songs are stored pre-handed the total estimation time of the proposed system is proportional to the time required for extraction of facial features. Also, the various classes of emotion yield a better accuracy rate as compared to previous existing systems. The computational time taken is 1.000sec which is very less thus helping in achieving a better real time performance and efficiency.
The system thus aims at providing the Windows operating system users with a cheaper, additional hardware free and accurate emotion-based music system. The Emotion Based Music System will be of great advantage to users looking for music based on their mood and emotional behaviour. It will help reduce the searching time for music thereby reducing the unnecessary computational time and thereby in- creasing the overall accuracy and efficiency of the system. Also, with its additional features mentioned above, it will be a complete system for music lovers and listeners.

# Future Enhancement
The proposed system might have many functions and it may be user friendly but the proposed system can have further advancement in future. The future scope in this system will be to create a mechanism that will be helpful in music therapy treatment and will provide the music therapist needed to treat patients suffering from disorders such as mental stress, anxiety, acute, depression and trauma. The proposed system is currently available on windows operating system, In future it will be available for the user using different operating system such as iOS, ubuntu etc. and mobile platform as well.
The proposed system tries to avoid unforeseen results generated in the future in extremely poor lighting conditions and very poor camera resolution. In the proposed work only one emotion is detected at a time so that it can be further enhanced to detect mixed emotion.
